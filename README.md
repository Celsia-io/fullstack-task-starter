# fullstack-task-starter

## Problem statement

Every company in the EU needs to report which activities it performs. These activities need to be from a list that the EU has prepared, you can find said list in [here](fullstack-task-starter/data/activities.json). To find the correct activities the company needs to be able to search through all the metadata of an activity (eg. name, description, nace codes..etc).

## Requirements

- [ ] Ability to find an activity by searching through its metadata
- [ ] A way to display information on an activity in the UI
- [ ] Ability to select activities + edit selection

## Technical requirements

- [ ] Use typescript/react.js for frontend (starter code in this repository is a suggestion)
- [ ] Free choice of backend technologies (or even none)
- [ ] [Chakra-ui](https://chakra-ui.com/) for UI components, and as closely as convinient styled similar to the design system found here: <https://www.figma.com/file/Uk64B2US4afbhw92uUkKyt/Vaadin-Design-System-(Community)?node-id=72%3A174>

## Task  limitations

- Please spend no more than 4 hours on developing the solution
- There are no limitations in terms of the scope of that solution – we have one goal, just to cover the user story and provide a working solution.
- Last but not least – there is no good or bad solution. It's up to you how you would like to solve the challenge. **Focus on your strengths, and what motivates you!**
